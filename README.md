# neuralStyleTransferWebApp

The web app uses the Python and the Flask framework in its backend. To run it locally using a code editor like Visual Studio Code, you need to do the following steps:
1. Have Flask implemented - follow the [tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/tutorial-flask) to set up the environment.
2. Download the trained models [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16UwZMAf6D6weVKXxPRsrZwGlbWCIPT0x?usp=sharing) and place them inside the "style_transfer_models" folder.
4. Install all the requirements from `requirements.txt` using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the `app.py` script and open the website on your local server.
